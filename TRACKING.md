Prompts:

Prompt 1:
Create a docker python web application. I want to make a flashcard game that randomly selects a US President and asks a multiple choice question. The questions should be what number president they are, the years they were president, or important legislation/acts they oversaw. 

Prompt 2:
I want to expand the data in  @data.py to include all US Presidents and move it to a SQLite db. The Dockerfile should build that into the  @Dockerfile and not not mount it.
