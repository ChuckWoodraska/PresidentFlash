Prompts:

Prompt 1:
Create a docker python web application. I want to make a flashcard game that randomly selects a US President and asks a multiple choice question. The questions should be what number president they are, the years they were president, or important legislation/acts they oversaw. 

Prompt 2:
I want to expand the data in  @data.py to include all US Presidents and move it to a SQLite db. The Dockerfile should build that into the  @Dockerfile and not not mount it. 

Number of Prompts needed: 2

Time: 45 minutes

Success:

Success

I had to do very little other than prompt and it basically 1 shotted what I was asking for. I needed to make minor changes for hosting because of how I set it up but probably could have even asked for the changes and had them made.
